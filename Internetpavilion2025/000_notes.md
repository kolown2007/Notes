In a 3D space, **(0,0,0)** corresponds to the origin point of the x, y, and z axes. It is the default origin and serves as a reference point for other objects in a virtual space. It is usually the center of the 3D coordinate system.

In the movie "Tron: Legacy" (2010), Sam Flynn is digitized and transported into the digital world called the Grid, and Quorra, an Isomorphic Algorithm, is able to leave the virtual world for the physical world.

The show "(0,0,0)" features artists who are working in some form within a 3D virtual environment, either partially or fully. The digital 3D objects in the show are created using a technique called photogrammetry, where multiple images from different angles are used to construct a 3D model.
