In a 3D space, **(0,0,0)** corresponds to the origin point of the x, y, and z axes. It is the default origin and serves as a reference point for other objects in a virtual space. It is usually the center of the 3D coordinate system.


In the movie "Tron: Legacy" (2010), Sam Flynn is digitized and transported into the digital world called the Grid, and Quorra, an Isomorphic Algorithm, is able to leave the virtual world for the physical world. In the 2021 metaverse hype, Facebook rebranded to Meta to reflect its focus on building the metaverse, a virtual reality space.


The show "(0,0,0)" features artists who are working in some form within a 3D virtual environment, either partially or fully. The digital 3D objects in the show are created using a technique called photogrammetry, where multiple images from different angles are used to construct a 3D model.


In the physical exhibition space, the 3D virtual objects on the screen are juxtaposed with their corresponding 3D physical objects. The exhibition also features a web app that the audience can view on their web browsers.


**Works Presented**

**Playground Artifact** by Franco Mamaril features a zebra sculpture scanned from a park in San Pedro, Laguna. He then uses the 3D file format to 3D print, turning the virtual object back into physical form. While the communication network today travels at the speed of light, how much data is lost and how much is transformed into its morbid counterparts during transmission?

Franco Mamaril, based in Laguna, PH, is a graffiti writer, VJ, video, and new media artist.


**PBB House** by Salawaki features a playhouse scanned by Bbbb and intervened by Salawaki, adding her 3D character. The girl holding a knife while livestreaming is a parody of the Britney Spears viral photo and the TikTok generation of oversharing for content's sake. Is the internet turning everyone into a housemate where everyone can see their drama live?

Salawaki is a digital artists working on 3d, NFTs, and the broad internet. She lives in between Siquijor and Davao. She co-founded Internet Pavilion in 2020.
