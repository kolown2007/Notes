**(0,0,0)**

In a 3D space, **(0,0,0)** corresponds to the origin point of the x, y, and z axes. It is the default origin and serves as a reference point for other objects in a virtual space. It is usually the center of the 3D coordinate system.


In the movie "Tron: Legacy" (2010), Sam Flynn is digitized and transported into the digital world called the Grid, and Quorra, an Isomorphic Algorithm, is able to leave the virtual world for the physical world. In the 2021 metaverse hype, Facebook rebranded to Meta to reflect its focus on building the metaverse, a virtual reality space. Today, with the advancement of new technologies, it has become easier to transform our physical likeness into digital counterparts and vice versa.

The show "(0,0,0)" features artists who are working in some form within a 3D virtual environment, either partially or fully. The digital 3D objects in the show are created using a technique called photogrammetry, where multiple images from different angles are used to construct a 3D model.


In the physical exhibition space, the 3D virtual objects on the screen are juxtaposed with their corresponding 3D physical objects. The exhibition also features a web app that the audience can view on their web browsers.

**Works Presented**

**Playground Artifact** by Franco Mamaril features a zebra sculpture scanned from a park in San Pedro, Laguna. He then uses the 3D file format to 3D print, turning the virtual object back into physical form. While the communication network today travels at the speed of light, how much data is lost and how much is transformed into its morbid counterparts during transmission?

Franco Mamaril, based in Laguna, PH, is a graffiti writer, VJ, video, and new media artist.

**PBB House** by Salawaki features a playhouse scanned by Bbbb and intervened by Salawaki, adding her 3D character. The girl holding a knife while livestreaming is a parody of the Britney Spears viral video,  and the TikTok generation of oversharing for content's sake. Is the internet turning everyone into a housemate where everyone can see their drama live?

Salawaki is a digital artists working on 3d, NFTs, and the broad internet. She lives in between Siquijor and Davao. She co-founded Internet Pavilion PH Islands in 2020.

**Jellyfish Invasion** by Jellyfish Kisses features one of her soft sculptures presented first presented in 2020 Art Fair PH Special projects. The soft sculpture is scanned in 2025 by Bbbb. 

As part of her artistic practice, Jellyfish Kisses constructs imagined environments through physical installations and is recently exploring 3D environments. While tech bros are pushing us toward techno-dystopianism, can these same tools be used by artists to imagine and help craft a humane society?

**Internet Pavilion of PH Islands 2025**

(0,0,0) is one of the activations for Internet Pavilion 2025. For the 2025 iteration, we will explore how we can interact with the internet beyond web browsers, what the possible modes of communication are in a future policed by AI and quantum technologies, and how we can build an alternative network?

----------------------------------


**(0,0,0) Technical Limitations**

Internet Pavilion's works rely on current web technologies. To render the 3D objects on the web, we are utilizing technologies called WebGL and WebGPU. While GPUs (hardware used to render graphics) are present in most modern devices, there are still older devices with limited support for them. This is one of the lapses we had not foreseen. For the devices running in the gallery spaces, we converted the 3D objects into animated GIFs to temporarily solve the problem in the physical installation. However, the 3D works can still be viewed in our web app. We will also be updating the online exhibitions throughout the show's duration.
