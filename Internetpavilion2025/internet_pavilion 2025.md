**Internet Pavilion** is a project exploring the internet as a tool, medium, and space for artists. The project is limited to artists working in the Philippines.

The 2024 iteration explores works that can be accessible on low-quality devices and slow-speed internet, which are common in Philippine rural areas. Most of the work involves optimizing the artists' code, but there are still many areas for improvement. The 2024 iteration was called **Philippine Islands Internet Pavilion 2024**.

The 2024 iteration can be viewed [here](https://internetpavilion2024.web.app/). It was presented in Anima Art Space, where a QR code was placed inside the space for the audience to scan and view the online works.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The 2025 iteration is still in the conceptualization process.**

For the 2025 iteration, we are exploring:

- Continuing the internet/ browser-based works and their optimization.

- Exploring the question: How can we interact with the internet beyond the web browsers?

- In a future global AI apocalypse, how do we send memes?

- we would also want to explore that each work is a "node" of the network and connects to the other collaborators.

- we want to explore also of the concept of Metaverse, digital likeness in the perspective of the "promdis"!
