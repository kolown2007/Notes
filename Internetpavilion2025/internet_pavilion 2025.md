DRAFT CONCEPT--- **Meta_Purok: ESC Biennale 2025**

The Internet Pavilion PH 2025 will align with the ESC 2025 curatorial theme of "tambay." In this iteration, we will explore the concept of the "Purok" as a metaphor for online spaces, highlighting how these digital puroks transcend physical barangay boundaries and connect beyond our current locality.

A Purok is an informal division within a barangay, yet it is more formal than a sitio due to its physical purok cottage structure. These structures serve as community centers, community gardens, and reading centers.

We will create a Meta_Purok, a web 3d environment that serves as a front for the projects . So every artists are considered to have a purok but not all are necessarily the same aesthetic. For example Franco and Salawaki could have a full 3d purok but others  could just have a link inside the meta_purok to their 2d and text projects.

Purok Siquijor - Salawakii

Purok San Pedro - Franco Mamaril

**Power Plants** (Luyo Space, Bogo Cebu..Ronyel Compra) -open for collaborators
 - (phase 1 photographing/ documentation and Identifying the plants in the Luyo_space community and  network )
 - collaborates with other individuals/ groups / to determine the medicinal and other uses of that plant. 
 - The web portal can export pdf for print and for identification.
 - Phase 2 - print the pdf as zine and distribute it back to the collaborators. For Esc the project might be until phase 1.

**Internet Pavilion** is a project exploring the internet as a tool, medium, and space for artists. The project is limited to artists working in the Philippines.

The 2024 iteration explores works that can be accessible on low-quality devices and slow-speed internet, which are common in Philippine rural areas. Most of the work involves optimizing the artists' code, but there are still many areas for improvement. The 2024 iteration was called **Philippine Islands Internet Pavilion 2024**.

The 2024 iteration can be viewed [here](https://internetpavilion2024.web.app/). It was presented in Anima Art Space, where a QR code was placed inside the space for the audience to scan and view the online works.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

**The 2025 iteration is still in the conceptualization process.**

For the 2025 iteration, we are exploring:

- Continuing the internet/ browser-based works and their optimization.

- Exploring the question: How can we interact with the internet beyond the web browsers?

- In a future global AI apocalypse, how do we send memes?

- we would also want to explore that each work is a "node" of the network and connects to the other collaborators.

- we want to explore also of the concept of Metaverse, digital likeness in the perspective of the "promdis"!
