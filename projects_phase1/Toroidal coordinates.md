 Imagine you have a donut. A toroidal coordinate system is a way to describe positions on this donut shape.

1. **The Donut's Hole**: Think of the hole in the middle of the donut. In toroidal coordinates, we have a circle that goes around this hole. We call this the "major circle."
    
2. **Around the Donut**: Now, imagine a smaller circle that goes around the donut itself, like the icing on top. This is the "minor circle."
    
3. **Coordinates**: To find a spot on the donut, you need two angles:
    
    - One angle tells you where you are around the big circle (the hole).
    - The other angle tells you where you are around the small circle (the icing).

So, toroidal coordinates help us find any spot on the donut by using these two angles. It's like having a map for a donut!
