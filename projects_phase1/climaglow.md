**Introduction:**
ClimaGlow is a project that explores the intersection of art, technology, and environmental science. By utilizing both historical and real-time weather data, we aim to craft artistic objects and installations that not only captivate audiences but also raise awareness about global climate change.

**Project Description:**
The core of ClimaGlow lies in its unique approach to data visualization. Our artworks are brought to life through DIY electronic screens, which dynamically display weather patterns and climate data. These installations serve as both aesthetic experiences and educational tools, encouraging viewers to engage with the pressing issue of climate change.

**Global Climate Change Context:**
Climate change is a global crisis that affects every corner of the planet. Rising temperatures, extreme weather events, and shifting ecosystems are just a few of the challenges we face. Through ClimaGlow, we aim to highlight these issues and inspire action by making the invisible impacts of climate change visible and tangible.

**Proponents:**
The project is spearheaded by a team of artists and technologists from the Philippines, a country that is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Our diverse backgrounds and shared passion for environmental advocacy drive our commitment to this project.
