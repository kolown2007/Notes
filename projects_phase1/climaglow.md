**Climaglow** is an electronic system and visual language that visualizes weather data through an abstract lighting display. 
The project will develop prototypes and create an abstract language system that corresponds to both real-time and historical weather data. Our aim is to present an alternative, intuitive, and artistic visual language, offering a contrast to the conventional numerical data displayed on phone screens. Additionally, we plan to construct affordable hardware using inexpensive components and found objects, alongside more refined materials.

The effects of climate change have introduced unpredictable weather patterns, which have become the new normal. In response, we aim to leverage existing technology, such as real-time data accessible via the internet, and the availability of affordable electronic hardware. By doing so, Climaglow seeks to create a dynamic and engaging way to understand and interact with weather data, making it more accessible and meaningful in our daily lives.
