your membership is only valid per cycle
a cycle in this context is a period of time that a group of projects are conducted.
1 cycle could be 6 months to a year.
all your involvement will be mediated inside the kolown app
as a token of appreciation based on your involvement we will send you objects within or after each cycle.
since its inception in 2007, Kolown evolved underwent many transformations and created many branches ie sticker distribution network, paste up crew, public intervention team etc and in this form could be its new branch.
we hope the tools that we will be releasing could also help you in your daily artistic work, by testing it you could also help KoloWn in general
We wont ask for any payment on the tools you will be using or the tokens that you will receive. We earn a little by selling some paintings or some grants or doing other sidequest to fund the servers and development and producing objects and interventions.
