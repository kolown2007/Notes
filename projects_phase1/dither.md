Dither is a technique used in digital signal processing and computer graphics to create the illusion of color depth or smooth transitions in images and audio. It involves adding a small amount of noise to the signal to mask quantization errors, which can occur when converting a continuous signal to a digital format with limited resolution. In images, dithering helps to simulate more colors than are actually available by blending pixels of different colors. In audio, it can help reduce the perception of distortion in low-bit-rate recordings.
