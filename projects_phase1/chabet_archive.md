- letter to asia art archive
Hello,

Good day!

I am KoloWn, an artist from the Philippines. I recently reached out to the Asia Art Archive's Instagram page and would like to inquire about the possibility of using the Roberto Chabet archive as a starting point to explore the limits and possibilities of conceptual art in the age of the Internet and Artificial Intelligence. While I don't have concrete ideas yet, I am considering using some of the texts and photos available online. The works will primarily be online and browser-based, but I am also exploring the potential for zines and other formats.

In 2017, I had the opportunity to exhibit at the Cultural Center of the Philippines, where I first encountered Roberto Chabet’s work and became fascinated by his conceptual approach to art-making. In 2018, Ringo Bunuan informed me that AAA hosts Chabet’s online archive. I would appreciate guidance on any rules regarding the use of images and text from the AAA website. Additionally, I am planning a visit to Hong Kong this March and would be interested in viewing the physical archive.

Thank you so much for your assistance.

Best regards,

KoloWn
