In the year 2050, in a parallel universe, an AI overlord has seized control of the global communication network. The world is also grappling with rising sea levels, causing extreme high and low tides. To maintain communication, the Soviets have developed a decentralized mesh network. Each node in this network is a portable antenna tower, known as a station, which must be defended against relentless AI and robotic attacks.

As the tides reach their peak, the Soviets deploy inflatable boats to navigate the flooded landscape. The stations are designed to be dismantled quickly, allowing for a swift escape. Your mission is to defend these stations from enemy forces, ensure a safe retreat during peak high tides, and reassemble the stations in new locations to keep the mesh network operational. The survival of communication—and perhaps humanity itself—depends on your success
