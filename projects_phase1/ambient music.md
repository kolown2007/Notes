1. **Sound Sources**: Use oscillators, noise generators, or sample players to create the basic sound sources. Ambient music often uses smooth, evolving textures, so consider using sine waves or noise with filters.
    
2. **Effects**: Apply effects like reverb, delay, and chorus to create a spacious and immersive sound. Tone.js has built-in effects that can be easily applied to your sound sources.
    
3. **Modulation**: Use LFOs (Low-Frequency Oscillators) to modulate parameters like pitch, filter cutoff, or volume to create evolving textures.
    
4. **Sequencing**: Use Tone.js's scheduling capabilities to create patterns or sequences that evolve over time. Ambient music often benefits from slow, evolving changes rather than fast, repetitive sequences.
    
5. **Randomization**: Introduce randomness to parameters to create a more organic and less predictable sound.
