Pitch, roll, and yaw are Euler angles that describe the orientation (rotation) of an object in 3D space, relative to a fixed reference frame (like gravity or north). They're commonly used in sensors like the MPU6050 to represent how something is tilted or turned.

- **Pitch**: Rotation around the lateral (side-to-side) axis. Like nodding your head up/down. Positive pitch tilts forward (nose down).
- **Roll**: Rotation around the longitudinal (front-to-back) axis. Like tilting your head side-to-side. Positive roll tilts to the right.
- **Yaw**: Rotation around the vertical (up-down) axis. Like turning your head left/right. Positive yaw turns clockwise.
