### Colors of the Wind 

 **Version 1** (2021-2022)
  An online experiment by KoloWn that tapped into real-time environmental data from third-party sources, visualized through a dynamic web interface.

 **Version 2** (2023) 
 Translated into a physical installation at Joya Gallery (Cebu), Punlaan Art Space(Cavite), Ninuno Gallery(QC) in 2023, called **Stations**. Inspired by rural antennas and street barricades, this iteration explored how infrastructure can become both signal and sculpture.

 **Version 3 (Upcoming)** A hybrid approach that integrates real-time weather data from PAG-ASA with custom-built systems. This version will extend the project’s dialogue between digital streams and physical presence, shaping a new interface where climate information becomes both tangible and poetic.

### **Colors of the Wind — Version 3**

**Conceptual Frame**
If Version 1 was about _seeing data_ and Version 2 about _embodying infrastructure_, Version 3 becomes about _building weather language_. By combining PAG-ASA’s real-time weather streams with custom-built receivers and sculptural interfaces, this iteration shifts from passive visualization to active translation—turning climate into signal, story, and play.

### **Objectives**

- **Invent a DIY weather station**: Construct instruments—antennas, barricades, or hybrid objects—that both capture and perform weather.

- **Localize the climate**: Root the project in the Philippines via PAG-ASA data, tying climate information to everyday rhythms and vulnerabilities.

- **Expose unpredictability**: Embrace glitches, delays, and mismatches as aesthetic features, highlighting the fragility of human attempts to “read” the weather.

- **Fuse science and sculpture**: Treat meteorological tools as art objects, collapsing the boundary between infrastructure and installation.

- **Make weather witty**: Translate humidity, rainfall, or wind into playful metaphors—stations that “sweat,” barricades that “shiver,” antennas that “sing.”

- **Produce a catalog/manual**: Document the process and provide guides for building stations, turning the project into an open-source toolkit for artists, communities, and educators.

- **Experiment with dynamic interfaces**: Develop interactive, evolving user interfaces that respond to both PAG-ASA data and DIY station inputs—interfaces that shift in real time, glitch, or morph, making climate information feel alive and unpredictable.
