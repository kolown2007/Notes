  Ghost_in_the_Machine is an art installation that combines physical and digital elements to delve into the themes of remote work, troll farms, virtual assistance, and the effects of the digital age on our daily lives. The project seeks to highlight the often overlooked yet essential workforce that operates behind our device screens.   
  The work features 30 plus smartphones affixed to the walls, their wires conspicuously exposed, evoking the image of troll farms. In addition, an interactive browser-based application will be developed to exhibit a series of digital works. This application will be interactive, enabling audience members to control it using their phones. 
  This serves as a metaphor for global connectivity, underscoring the dual role of our devices as tools for connection and a potential sources of harm.   Furthermore, the project prompts us to question the roles of the human laborers performing menial tasks and the AI performing intellectual tasks in the virtual world. It asks us to consider who are the ghosts and who are the machines in this digital age.
