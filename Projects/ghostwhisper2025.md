**GhostWhisper** is an exploration of a DIY sound system that encompasses both hardware and software. The project is developed by KoloWn and Roan Alvarez for the QC Biennale 2025. The system is flexible and can be customized by artists for their own sound installations. The work is under development and more features will be added in the future.

Currently, The GhostWhisper system plays sound based on three programs: generative, which plays sound sequences based on algorithms; shuffle, which plays random sounds from a collection; and stream, which plays sound from the GhostWhisper remote servers.

For the show "The Elephant" at Ninuno Gallery, KoloWn’s work features sounds scraped from the internet, such as archived sounds, environmental recordings, YouTube audios, and viral social media sound clips. The sounds are algorithmically sequenced and, combined with the GhostWhisper system, can be controlled by some of the collaborators in the space.

KoloWn’s choice of sound for this show reflects their practice of utilizing found objects. It also questions the blurred areas between social media remixing, piracy, and the paradox of division in the connected internet era.
