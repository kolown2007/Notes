**ghost_control** is the fourth iteration of the _ghost_projects_ series (2024 to present). Earlier works include _Ghost_in_the_Machine_ (2024, Leeum Museum of Art), _GhostWriter_ (2024 - 2025, Ateneo Art Gallery), and _GhostWhisper_ (2025, QC, ESC, and Thailand Biennales).

_ghost_projects_ investigates the hidden algorithms shaping everyday life in the age of internet.
In **ghost_control**, a crate-like structure contains a work-from-home environment-like setup with screens, lights, and sound. The screens show games, dashboard graphics, and video fragments. Visitors can interact with the installation through their phones.

The work reflects on the shifting conditions of contemporary labor, where the boundaries of home and factory dissolve. Remote work, digital nomadism, and platform-driven economies form the backdrop for this exploration of productivity, intimacy, and control.
