The word TradeWinds derived from the wind that powered the European Colonial expansion. While galleon trades relied on wind and nature.
TradeWinds on the other hand is built on top of modern web technologies and the internet.  

**The project consists of two components:**

an interactive screen(s) in a space,
webapp to control the screen.  

Audiences can interact to the installation in real-time using their phones.  

The **TradeWinds** series experiments on how images and thoughts in contemporary times are shared, generated, processed, and saturated.
