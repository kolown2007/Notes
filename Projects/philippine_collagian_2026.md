**Philippine_Collagian** is a web-based looping collage generator. Since its inception in 2019, the project has undergone multiple iterations and spawned complex spinoffs.

The word **Collagian** is a spoof of **Philippine Collegian**, the student publication of the University of the Philippines-Diliman. Here it becomes a playful detournement, shifting from collegiate journalism to collage.

While the present era is defined by photorealistic image generation, this chapter turns deliberately toward its earliest impulses, embracing fragments and street-level tactility. 

Unlike the predictable outputs of AI systems, here the process begins with a hint of the base sources such as photographs and scans of ordinary street fragments such as papers, posters, tarps, markings, and advertisements, but chance and algorithmic distribution transform them into unexpected forms. 

These fragments are arranged into a looping collage that echoes the textures of the Philippine streets.
