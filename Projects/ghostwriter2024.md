**GhostWriter2024** is an installation composed of real-time web application that creates fake stories based on current events. The app grabs current headlines from Philippine news sites and then using the Large language model GPT4, it creates a sci-fi story and it is projected on the screen.

On the other screen the audience can submit words that can influence the fictional stories. The app updates 4x a day.  
The work is a response to the proliferation of fake news, the possible impact of AI in our lives. The sources came from real-time news headlines.

The work is inspired on how we sometimes consume news based on headlines without reading the whole article and how some news sources create click-baity headlines that are sometimes far from its content.
