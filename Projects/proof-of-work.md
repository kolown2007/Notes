The project draws inspiration from:
1.) In 2020, we created a web-based project called ECQ planner. It generated a list of random activities to be done during the lockdown period. Proof-Of-Work is the spinoff of that project.
2.) Proof-of-Work is also inspired from the rule of data in our contemporary lives. From Octa Research predictions on covid-19 surges, SWS predictions on election results. While we see a dystopian use of data to manipulate consumer behavior and political agenda such as the Cambridge Analytica scandal, we are interested in how to use data to inform what is really happening today and of the future. We also recognize the scope of this project that this is not a strict data science but an art project.
3.) It is inspired from the traditional Daily Time Record and punch card from our experience in work and how it is similar and contrasts with the latest time record keeping in the digital, work from home set-up.
