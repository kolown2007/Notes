Kolown employs an interventionist strategy, engaging with street spaces, digital platforms, archives and found objects. Their process transforms and deconstructs existing forms—altering both structure and content to generate new narratives.

Over the past three years, Kolown has collected paper bags, packaging, and other discarded paper materials, assembling them into a layered collage. The elements were arranged intuitively, with additional details introduced through digital tools, photo editing, and algorithmic processes. Using digital fabrication, select forms were cut and embedded back into the physical composition. Throughout, meaning is continuously disrupted and reassembled—the tactile layering and visible seams becoming a metaphor for systems of accumulation, erosion, and recomposition.
