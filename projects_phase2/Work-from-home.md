**fractals** - Fractals are complex geometric shapes that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole, a property known as self-similarity. They are often created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop, and are used to model structures in nature like snowflakes, mountain ranges, and coastlines.

**The Mandelbrot set** is a famous fractal named after mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. It is defined as the set of complex numbers for which the function  does not diverge when iterated from , meaning the sequence remains bounded in absolute value. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set exhibits an intricate and infinitely complex structure, making it a popular subject for mathematical visualization

**Work From Home Installation Concept**

The art installation, titled "Remote Realities," features a life-sized, hyper-realistic work-from-home setup, complete with a desk, chair, and computer, all crafted from transparent acrylic to symbolize the blurred boundaries between personal and professional life. The computer screen displays a looping video of a virtual meeting, while ambient sounds of keyboard typing and distant chatter fill the space, immersing visitors in the experience. The installation invites viewers to reflect on the evolving nature of work and the impact of technology on human interaction

"Ghost of the Future" is a concept often associated with the character from Charles Dickens' novella "A Christmas Carol." In the story, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, also known as the Ghost of the Future, is a silent, foreboding spirit that shows the protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge, visions of what his future could be if he continues on his current path. This ghost is typically depicted as a grim, hooded figure and serves as a catalyst for Scrooge's transformation by confronting him with the consequences of his actions.

 **parallax** or **parallax scrolling**.

In both 2D and 3D games, **parallax** refers to the phenomenon where objects that are farther away from the camera move more slowly than objects that are closer, as the camera moves side-to-side (or up/down). This creates a sense of depth and immersion.
