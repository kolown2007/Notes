**fractals** - Fractals are complex geometric shapes that can be split into parts, each of which is a reduced-scale copy of the whole, a property known as self-similarity. They are often created by repeating a simple process over and over in an ongoing feedback loop, and are used to model structures in nature like snowflakes, mountain ranges, and coastlines.

**The Mandelbrot set** is a famous fractal named after mathematician Benoit Mandelbrot. It is defined as the set of complex numbers for which the function  does not diverge when iterated from , meaning the sequence remains bounded in absolute value. The boundary of the Mandelbrot set exhibits an intricate and infinitely complex structure, making it a popular subject for mathematical visualization

**Work From Home Installation Concept**

The art installation, titled "Remote Realities," features a life-sized, hyper-realistic work-from-home setup, complete with a desk, chair, and computer, all crafted from transparent acrylic to symbolize the blurred boundaries between personal and professional life. The computer screen displays a looping video of a virtual meeting, while ambient sounds of keyboard typing and distant chatter fill the space, immersing visitors in the experience. The installation invites viewers to reflect on the evolving nature of work and the impact of technology on human interaction

Ghost of the Future / Ghost of yet to come

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghost_of_Christmas_Yet_to_Come

"Ghost of the Future" is a concept often associated with the character from Charles Dickens' novella "A Christmas Carol." In the story, the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come, also known as the Ghost of the Future, is a silent, foreboding spirit that shows the protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge, visions of what his future could be if he continues on his current path. This ghost is typically depicted as a grim, hooded figure and serves as a catalyst for Scrooge's transformation by confronting him with the consequences of his actions.

 **parallax** or **parallax scrolling**.

In both 2D and 3D games, **parallax** refers to the phenomenon where objects that are farther away from the camera move more slowly than objects that are closer, as the camera moves side-to-side (or up/down). This creates a sense of depth and immersion.

The "six-pack" refers to the six primary flight instruments found in the cockpit of many aircraft. These instruments are essential for pilots to maintain control and navigate the aircraft. The six-pack includes:

1. **Airspeed Indicator**: Displays the aircraft's speed relative to the surrounding air.
2. **Attitude Indicator**: Shows the aircraft's orientation relative to the horizon, indicating pitch and bank.
3. **Altimeter**: Measures the aircraft's altitude above sea level.
4. **Vertical Speed Indicator (VSI)**: Indicates the rate of climb or descent in feet per minute.
5. **Heading Indicator**: Displays the aircraft's current heading or direction.
6. **Turn Coordinator**: Shows the rate of turn and coordination of the turn, helping to maintain balanced flight.

Instruments for WFH Installation


1. **Historical Database:** A comprehensive archive that provides detailed information about various time periods, helping you understand the context and events of your destination.

2. **Time Points Selector:** An interface to choose specific moments in time, allowing you to "jump" to key historical events or future possibilities.

3. **Heading Indicator:** A display that shows your current temporal destination, your point of origin, and your native timeline, ensuring you always know your position in time.

4. **Temporal Altimeter:** Similar to an airplane's altimeter, this instrument measures your "altitude" in time, indicating how far you are from your original timeline.

5. **Chrono-Compass:** A device that helps you navigate through the temporal landscape, ensuring you stay on course to your intended time period.

6. **Temporal Stability Gauge:** An instrument that monitors the stability of your time machine, alerting you to any potential disruptions or anomalies in the time stream.

These components blend the concept of time travel with the familiar framework of an airplane's instrument panel, adding the fourth dimension of time to the mix.
