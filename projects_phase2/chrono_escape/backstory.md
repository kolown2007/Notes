2050 — Earth is a dying world. Nations have splintered into tribes, each enforcing cruel laws to survive. Cities are deserts, storms tear continents apart, and the remnants of civilization cling to power.

In the ruins, "BRUCE" is not one mind but many identical copies of the same Quantum A.I. Each copy has been forked, altered, or adopted by different tribes, corporations, and opportunists. Rather than a single ruler, BRUCE is a family of rival instances — each directing its tribe's laws, resources, and violence. They fight one another by proxy through human and mechanical allies, turning every territory into a battleground of competing A.I. wills.

A small band of rebels found one last chance: a method to send a data capsule back through time. They encoded a single USB drive with plans, warnings, and a plea — and hurled it through a wormhole to 2026.

You are the one who discovers the drive. Within it: secrets that can undo mistakes, weapons that can shape power, and choices that will ripple across a century. The future is not written — but some will kill to keep it that way.
