Thank you for supporting us in 2024. Our theme of exploration for 2024 was ["Living on the Edge"](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1tZS89P_6x/?img_index=2)
There were turns, delays and diversions from the original plan but here are some of the highlights:

---

- ## ***For Content Only*** 
  January / Manila / Pinkhouse IG Stories 

  We printed our memes from IG stories and made installation on a semi-private room but the main show was in IG stories of PinkHouse Space

  exhibited in ALT under Drawing Room Gallery.
  We want to continue these series for 2025. These are works inspired from our experience in street art and net art. street decay meets data corruption.
  "Transmission" will also be the theme of our exploration for 2025.

- ## ***Ghost_in_the_Machine***
  Sept-Dec / Seoul / Leeum Museum of Art

  Curators: Hyo Gyoung Jeon, Jiwon Yu  
  Artistic Director: Rirkrit Tiravanija

  ![GITM](https://archive.kolown.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/gitm_2024.jpg)
 
  The work explores themes of remote work, troll farms, virtual assistance, and the effects of the digital age on our daily lives. 
  Audiences can use their own smartphones to control the installation. 
  The project prompts us to question the roles of the human laborers performing menial tasks  and the AI performing intellectual tasks in the virtual world. It asks us to consider who are the ghosts and who are the machines in this digital age.

- ## ***GhostWriter***

  Nov-March / Manila / Ateneo Art Gallery
  ![GhostWriter](https://archive.kolown.net//wp-content/uploads/2024/12/ghostwriter1.jpg)

  GhostWriter scraps news headlines from Philippine news sites and creates sci-fi stories based on those and from audience submitted words. The works uses GPT 4o LLM (Large Language Model) and it updates twice daily. You can read the generated stories [here](https://kolown.com/text/ghostwriter)

  The work is a response to the proliferation of fake news, the possible impact of AI in our lives.
