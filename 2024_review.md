**KoloWn_2024: Love, Data, & Bots**



Thank for supporting us in 2024. Our theme of exploration for 2024 was ["Living on the Edge"](https://www.instagram.com/p/C1tZS89P_6x/?img_index=2). 
There are turns, delays and diversions from the original plan but here are some of the highlights:

- **For Content Only** 
  January / Manila / Pinkhouse IG Stories 
  
  We printed our memes from IG stories and made installation on a semi-private room but the main show is in IG stories of PinkHouse Space
  
- **Transmission Series**
  February / Manila / ALT Fair - The Drawing Room
  
  These series of painting started in 2023 exhibited in ALT under Drawing Room.
  We want to continue these series for 2025. These are works inspired from our experience in street art and net art.  street decay meets data corruption.

- **Proof-Of-Work** 
  July / Toronto / Gallery TPW -4th Kamias Triennial

  This is a series started in 2022. It is a data gathering project. 
  
- **Ghost_in_the_Machine**
  Sept-Dec / Seoul / Leeum Museum of Art

is an art installation that combines physical and digital elements to delve into the themes of remote work, troll farms, virtual assistance, and the effects of the digital age on our daily lives. The project seeks to highlight the often overlooked yet essential workforce that operates behind our device screens.  
   
The work featured 30 plus smartphones affixed to the walls, their wires conspicuously exposed, evoking the image of troll farms. In addition, an interactive browser-based application will be developed to exhibit a series of digital works. This application will be interactive, enabling audience members to control it using their phones. This serves as a metaphor for global connectivity, underscoring the dual role of our devices as tools for connection and a potential sources of harm.  
   
Furthermore, the project prompts us to question the roles of the human laborers performing menial tasks and the AI performing intellectual tasks in the virtual world. It asks us to consider who are the ghosts and who are the machines in this digital age.

- **GhostWriter**
(archive)[archive](https://kolown.com/projects/ghostwriter/)

is an installation composed of realtime web application that creates fake stories based on current events. The app grabs current headlines from Philippine news sites and then using the Large language model GPT4, it creates a sci-fi story and it is projected on the screen.

On the other screen the audience can submit words that can influence the fictional stories. The app updates 4x a day.  
The work is a response to the proliferation of fake news, the possible impact of AI in our lives. The sources came from realtime news headlines.

The work is inspired on how we sometimes consume news based on headlines without reading the whole article and how some news sources create click-baity headlines that are sometimes far from its content.
